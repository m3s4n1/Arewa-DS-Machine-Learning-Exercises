Title:
Bridging the Gaps: Trends and Determinants of HIV Testing among Young Women (15-24 years) in Nigeria — Insights from 2007-2016

Abstract:
This paper examines trends in HIV testing, knowledge, and preventive behaviors among young women aged 15–24 in Nigeria across three survey waves (MICS 2007, 2011, 2016). We aim to identify which demographic groups have lagged behind in HIV testing uptake, how improvements correlate with changes in education, region, and knowledge, and what barriers persist. Findings could inform policy to ensure equitable access to HIV testing. We also consider what to do if data show unexpected or problematic patterns, or if key variables are missing or ambiguous.


Introduction
HIV remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis through HIV testing is crucial both for individual treatment and for preventing further spread. Yet not all young people have equal access to testing or awareness. In Nigeria, young women aged 15-24 represent an especially important group both because of biological, social, and economic vulnerabilities. By analyzing data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) from 2007, 2011, and 2016, this project explores how HIV testing, knowledge, and prevention behavior have changed over time in this group and which factors are associated with testing uptake.


Methods:
Using the MICS datasets for Nigeria for years 2007, 2011, 2016. (https://tropmedhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41182-025-00737-1?utm_source)

Variables of interest:
• HIV testing status (ever tested, recent testing)
• HIV-related knowledge (composite indicators)
• Preventive behaviors (e.g. condom use, etc.)
• Demographics: age (15-19 vs 20-24), education level, region/geopolitical zone, urban vs rural residence.

Statistical methods: Descriptive trends across years; logistic regression to find associations (which groups more or less likely to test); maybe difference-in-difference or trend test.

Results (hypothetical / what I might expect)

Over the decade, HIV testing among young women likely increased significantly (as the MICS study reports: in 2007 only ~7.6% tested; in 2016 ~58.8%) (https://tropmedhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41182-025-00737-1?utm_source)

Knowledge and preventive behavior also improve over time.

But gaps remain: e.g. those in rural areas, with lower education, in certain geopolitical zones lagging behind.

Discussion
What the revelations might reveal:
Progress is real: greater knowledge → more testing.
Socioeconomic inequities: education, wealth, urban/rural residence strongly influence who gets tested.

What if the revelations are problematic:
If some regions have very low testing or knowledge, it implies that public health resources have not been evenly distributed, and marginalized groups are being left behind. This could reflect structural inequalities.
If data show that despite high knowledge, testing still low, that suggests barriers beyond knowledge (stigma, lack of access, cost, culture).

I would ensure that findings are communicated sensitively: avoid shaming; highlight strengths as well as gaps; ensure anonymity of respondents; consider policy implications carefully, particularly for resource allocation.


What if data doesn’t unlock everything?

Maybe some variables are missing (e.g. stigma beliefs, or data on self-testing vs clinic testing). The surveys might not have asked about HIV self-testing in those years.
Maybe “recent testing” variable is not collected consistently.
If data quality is poor, standard errors large, survey weighting different etc., then findings might be less robust.
In such case, I would:
Use supplementary data: DHS, more recent surveys.
Use qualitative studies (e.g. preferences among youth) to understand barriers.
Be transparent about uncertainties. Use confidence intervals. Highlight what we don’t know.

Scenarios

Scenario A: All demographic groups improve, but rural/low-education remain significantly behind. → Story: “Rapid Gains Everywhere — Yet a Rural Gap Persists.”
Scenario B: Some unexpected group has declining testing (e.g., despite urban setting). → Investigate possible causes: policy changes? survey artifacts?
Scenario C: Data show plateau or drop after 2016. → Maybe interventions lost momentum; require policy attention.
Scenario D: Key variables missing or inconsistent. → Emphasis shifts to data-collection improvements; recommendations for future surveys to include newer variables (e.g. self-testing, stigma, access).
