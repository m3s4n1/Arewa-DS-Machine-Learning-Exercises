# Form Design Recommendations

Issues Identified in the Current Form (`index.html`):

- ❌ `Birth Month` is a free text field — leads to inconsistent inputs like "jan", "January", "01", etc.
- ❌ `State` is also free text — inconsistent casing, abbreviations, and typos.
- ❓ `Dogs or Cats?` only allows single selection, but the question implies the user may want both.

**Recommendations:**

1. Replace `Birth Month` with a dropdown of fixed month values.
2. Replace `State` input with a dropdown of valid options or use autocomplete.
3. Reword "Dogs or Cats?" to "Which do you prefer?" or allow checkboxes for multiple selection.

I believe that these changes will ensure cleaner and more consistent data in future entries.
